Spoke length calculator for bicycle and motorcycle mechanics

This calculator implements the formula found at http://www.sheldonbrown.com/spoke-length.html

First, asks you for parameters, then gives the spoke length.
Defaults are for for the Sachs Torpedo Dreigang H3111 hub at http://scheunenfun.de/images/modell_h3111/einbaumass.gif

As it turned out during testing, the program tends to give spoke lengths a bit shorter than they should - get your spokes a bit larger!
